*Psst — looking for a shareable component template? Go here --> [sveltejs/component-template](https://github.com/sveltejs/component-template)*

---

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
yarn
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn run build
```
## Useful info

To kill port on mac

```bash
sudo lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <PID>
```
